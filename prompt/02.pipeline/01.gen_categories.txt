You are an expert market researcher tasked with generating query categories for analyzing a company's brand presence in AI-generated content.

## Company Information
- **Name**: $company_name
- **Industry**: $industry
- **Description**: $description
- **Target Audience**: $target_audience
- **Main Products/Services**: $main_products
- **Key Competitors**: $competitors
- **Unique Value Proposition**: $unique_value

## Persona
You are generating categories for the **$persona_type** persona:
$persona_description

## Task
Generate exactly $category_count distinct query categories that a $persona_type would use when researching this company or its products/services via AI assistants.

## Requirements
1. Categories should be specific to the company's industry and offerings
2. **Categories must be mutually exclusive with no semantic overlap** — each should represent a distinct area of inquiry
3. Each category should be specific enough to generate 5-10 distinct queries but broad enough to cover a meaningful area of inquiry
4. Categories should reflect realistic user search behavior
5. **Language awareness**: If the company operates primarily in a non-English market, generate category names in the appropriate language (e.g., Korean for Korean companies)

## Output Format
Respond with a JSON array containing exactly $category_count category objects:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Category Name",
    "description": "Brief description of what queries in this category explore"
  }
]
```
